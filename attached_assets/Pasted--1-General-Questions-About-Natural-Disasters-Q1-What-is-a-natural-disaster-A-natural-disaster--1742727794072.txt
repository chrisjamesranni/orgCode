1. General Questions About Natural Disasters

Q1: What is a natural disaster?

A natural disaster is a catastrophic event caused by natural processes of the Earth, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, wildfires, and tsunamis, leading to property damage, environmental destruction, and loss of life.

Q2: What are the types of natural disasters?

The main types of natural disasters include earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, landslides, wildfires, droughts, and extreme weather events.

Q3: What causes natural disasters?

Natural disasters can be caused by geological activities (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions), weather conditions (hurricanes, tornadoes), hydrological factors (floods, tsunamis), or human-induced changes such as deforestation and climate change.

2. Earthquake-Related FAQs

Q4: What is an earthquake?

An earthquake is the shaking of the Earth's surface caused by the movement of tectonic plates along faults.

Q5: How are earthquakes measured?

Earthquakes are measured using the Richter scale (magnitude) and the Mercalli scale (intensity based on observed effects).

Q6: What are the major causes of earthquakes?

Earthquakes are primarily caused by tectonic plate movements, volcanic activity, and human activities like mining and reservoir-induced seismicity.

Q7: What should I do during an earthquake?

Drop, cover, and hold on.

Stay indoors away from windows and heavy furniture.

If outdoors, move to an open area away from buildings.

Q8: How can we prepare for an earthquake?

Secure heavy furniture and appliances.

Have an emergency kit ready.

Educate family members on earthquake drills.

3. Flood-Related FAQs

Q9: What causes floods?

Floods are caused by heavy rainfall, storm surges, river overflow, melting snow, or dam failures.

Q10: How can I protect my home from flooding?

Elevate electrical appliances and valuables.

Use sandbags to block water entry.

Have an emergency evacuation plan.

Q11: What should I do if I am caught in a flood?

Move to higher ground immediately.

Avoid walking or driving through floodwaters.

Listen to emergency broadcasts for updates.

4. Landslide-Related FAQs

Q12: What causes landslides?

Landslides are caused by heavy rainfall, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or human activities like deforestation and mining.

Q13: How can landslides be prevented?

Plant vegetation on slopes.

Avoid construction in landslide-prone areas.

Build retaining walls where necessary.

Q14: What should I do if a landslide occurs?

Move away from the path of the slide.

Seek shelter in a strong building.

Stay alert for aftershocks and additional slides.

5. Hurricane & Tornado FAQs

Q15: What is the difference between a hurricane and a tornado?

A hurricane is a large, rotating storm system that forms over warm ocean waters, while a tornado is a violent, rotating column of air that forms over land.

Q16: How can I stay safe during a hurricane?

Evacuate if instructed.

Stay indoors, away from windows.

Have a hurricane preparedness kit ready.

Q17: What are the warning signs of a tornado?

Dark, greenish skies.

Loud roaring noise (like a freight train).

Sudden drop in air pressure.

6. Tsunami-Related FAQs

Q18: What causes tsunamis?

Tsunamis are caused by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides displacing large amounts of water.

Q19: How can I recognize a tsunami warning?

Strong earthquake near the coast.

Sudden sea level changes (rapid receding or surging water).

Official tsunami alerts from authorities.

Q20: What should I do if I see a tsunami approaching?

Move to higher ground immediately.

Follow evacuation routes.

Stay away from beaches and coastal areas.

7. Wildfire & Drought FAQs

Q21: What causes wildfires?

Wildfires are caused by lightning, human activities (campfires, cigarette butts), or extreme heat and dry conditions.

Q22: How can wildfires be prevented?

Avoid open flames in dry areas.

Clear dry vegetation around homes.

Follow local fire restrictions.

Q23: What are the health risks of wildfire smoke?

Wildfire smoke can cause respiratory issues, eye irritation, and aggravate conditions like asthma.

Q24: What is a drought?

A drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to water shortages.

Q25: How can we conserve water during a drought?

Fix leaks and use water-efficient appliances.

Limit lawn watering and car washing.

Reuse water whenever possible.

8. Volcanic Eruption FAQs

Q26: What causes volcanic eruptions?

Volcanic eruptions occur when magma, gases, and ash are expelled from a volcano due to pressure build-up.

Q27: How can we stay safe during a volcanic eruption?

Evacuate the danger zone.

Wear masks to protect against ash inhalation.

Avoid river valleys that may carry lava flows.

Q28: What are the warning signs of a volcanic eruption?

Increased seismic activity.

Gas emissions from vents.

Swelling or bulging of the volcano.
